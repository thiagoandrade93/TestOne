# TestOne


Hey guys,
welcome to project TestOne projetc.

In addition to performing the test on the platform, I ran the tests using Selenium with Java. The tests are running using the Google Chrome browser.
In addition, the project uses PageObject and best practices.
To run in your browser, you will need to download ChromeDrive and point to its directory in the "constants" class.

Hope you like it!
